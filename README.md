## ABOUT NSC
NSC is a GUI utility which converts a binary sequence into a network signal in one of six codings:

## INSTALLATION AND RUN

1. Make sure Java 8 (JRE or JDK) is installed: it is free and takes a couple of minutes. Here is the link:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

2. Download the cross-platform NSC executable JAR file from here:
https://github.com/nick-ivanov/nsc/raw/master/executable/NSC-1.0.0.jar

3. Open the terminal and go into the directory where the JAR file is located (use *cd* command). For example, if the JAR file is in /home/jack/Downloads, the command will be as follows:

```
cd /home/jack/Downloads
```

4. Now run the file using the following command:

```
java -jar NSC-1.0.0.jar
```

If everything is done correctly, you will see application window on the screen.
